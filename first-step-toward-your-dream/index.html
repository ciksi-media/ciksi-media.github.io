                                <p>Leading a team can be inspiring, rewarding and exhausting. Busy working environments can leave little time for team leaders to check-in with team members and ensure they’re feeling happy, creative and on track. But with these 6 simple and effective team management tips, there’s an alternative.</p>
<p><h3>How to Achieve Effective Team Management</h3></p>
<p>With good communication channels and plenty of opportunities to give feedback, you can provide your team with a strong support system. With this, team leaders can develop accountability, trust, and a less hierarchical approach.</p>
<p>Here are our six tips for achieving a happier and more productive team via some supportive workflows:</p>
<p><b>1. Be transparent</b></p>
<p>Transparent working environments have been found to make teams more accountable, happy and creative.</p>
<p>It sounds like a big claim but transparent environments help to develop a feeling of mutual respect between team members and team leaders. Via open and consistent communication, transparent and authentic workplaces help employees to feel secure in their positions. In turn, team members feel freer to contribute ideas and suggestions, enhancing creativity.</p>
<p>Marc de Grandpre, senior VP of Marketing at KIND Healthy Snacks, believes that transparency in the workplace is hugely important. Marc explains how they use transparency for effective team management at their company:</p>
<p>“How can your company learn, grow and succeed if people are afraid to be themselves, voice their opinions and genuinely show that they care about the brand and team? Having the company become a sort of safe space allows for brilliant ideas to flow and for problems in your company to be flagged and addressed head-on.”</p>
<p>Marc and his team aim to make all employees feel in the loop, respected and valued. Consequently, they found that each team member felt happier in their job, while also more creative and loyal.</p>
<p><b>2. Keep communicating</b></p>
<p>You must have heard this one before: the basis of a cooperative and productive team is good communication.</p>
<p>The aim is to create an environment in which team leaders feel able to provide honest and constructive feedback, and team members feel confident to voice concerns and communicate with one another.</p>
<p>For teams with members working remotely, Google Hangouts can provide an ideal way to ensure some face-to-face time is achieved.</p>
<p>If your distributed team is working across time zones and you’d like to set up a standing appointment for calls, it’s important to find a time which works for everyone involved. By not always holding calls at inconvenient times for the remote team member, they’ll be more open (and awake) to honestly and accurately communicate with you.</p>
<p><b>3. Provide valuable feedback</b></p>
<p>Providing feedback to team members is one of the best ways you can support them to develop professionally and personally.</p>
<p>Jean-François Manzoni, Professor of Leadership and Organizational Development at IMD International, explains:</p>
<p>“You do your star a disservice if you fail to help her figure out how she can continue to grow”</p>
<p>Even if you have no negative feedback to give, make sure to hold regular opportunities to check-in. This way, you can provide advice on how you feel your team members are progressing and could grow further. If there are any areas of work that you feel could be improved, these discussions also provide a good opportunity to share your constructive feedback.</p>
<p>So although feedback conversations can be difficult, especially in non-hierarchical organizations, they’re important and necessary for the development of team members and the success of your wider team.</p>
<p><b>4. Encourage collaboration</b></p>
<p>Inevitably, your team members will be happier if they can get along well with one another. As an added bonus, they’ll perform better too.</p>
<p>To achieve this, encourage your team members to collaborate. On your team, there will likely be a whole bunch of diverse skills. Make sure these different skillsets are utilized by ensuring everyone is aware of ongoing projects. That way, team members can jump in to collaborate wherever they feel they can bring value.</p>
<p>On our marketing team, for example, I’ll often draw on support from the SEO specialist while creating the content strategy. Equally, if I know the SEO specialist is coming up with text for a PPC campaign, I’ll offer to help. A collaborative task management tool can help this process by sharing the upcoming tasks for each team member with the rest of your team.</p>
<p><b>Try mapping out your ideas</b></p>
<p>For a less linear take on collaborative working, try using a collaborative online mind map. With MindMeister, multiple users are able to access mind maps at the same time, meaning team members can add their ideas, provide feedback or vote up or down on ideas. This can all be done in real-time, whether brainstorming in a meeting together, or working entirely remotely.</p>
<p>Generating ideas collaboratively while mind mapping has been found to boost creative thinking, as it integrates both the linear, convergent (left-brain) thinking with divergent, non-linear (right-brain) thinking. This engages the whole mind in processing and creating new information, using our visual, spatial and kinesthetic senses to come up with new ideas, increasing our creativity.</p>
<p><b>5. Trust your team to do their job</b></p>
<p>When I asked Michael Hollauf, MeisterLabs’ CEO, what his advice would be to other team leaders, he said it would be to always recognize when to delegate tasks.</p>
<p>Companies hire competent staff for a reason and effective team management shouldn’t mean micro-management. If you’ve hired staff for a specialist area like programming, you need to know when to just leave them to do their job.</p>
<p>Delegate tasks while staying in the loop</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be hard to let go. Especially if you’ve been working on a project for a while but need a team member to take it over. With MeisterTask, try using the Watching feature, where you can add yourself as a ‘watcher’. Becoming a ‘watcher’ allows you to remain in the loop with how the task is progressing and any related discussions.</p>
<p><b>6. Prevent team burn-out</b></p>
<p>As a team leader, you’re in a great position to set positive boundaries of work, play, and relaxation. In her article on managing work notifications, Belle Beth Cooper argues that it is the responsibility of employers to set the precedent about when and where team members should be switching off from work entirely. This could mean, for example, by not expecting team members to check emails after working hours.</p>
<p>Of course, this can be difficult. Particularly in teams where members work flexibly and might prefer to start early or work late, to save time elsewhere. However, encouraging team members to set themselves some working limits, to sleep well and avoid burn-out, is important.</p>
